<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Designed an algorithm in python that could that could find a stable matching between the preferences of a man and a women from a given set of data. Men would preference the women, and the women would preference the men. Based on each genders preference, the algorithm would satisfy everyones preferences.
